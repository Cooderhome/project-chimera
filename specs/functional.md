# Functional Specification

## Agent Capabilities & Architecture

### Trend Research
As an autonomous agent,
I need to fetch trending topics from supported platforms
so that content generation is contextually relevant.

### Content Generation
As an autonomous agent,
I need to generate captions and descriptions based on trends
so that media content aligns with platform expectations.

### Media Publishing
As an autonomous agent,
I need to publish generated content to external platforms
so that the influencer maintains an active presence.

### State Awareness & Coordination
As an autonomous agent,
I need to know my current operational state (idle, researching, publishing)
and be able to coordinate with the Orchestrator and Swarm for scalable, parallel execution and error recovery.

## Human Governance & Exception Management
As a human operator,
I need the ability to review specifications, tests, and centralized governance policies
so that unsafe or misaligned behavior is prevented before runtime and exceptions are managed efficiently.
